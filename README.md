AXI4-Lite UART Peripheral with UVM Verification
Designed a synthesizable AXI4-Lite UART in SystemVerilog and verified it using a layered UVM testbench with constrained-random sequences, coverage collection, and assertions. Built a Python-based golden model to decode and validate TX output, and automated simulation using ModelSim and GTKWave.


This module is an AXI4-Lite slave connected to a simple UART TX + RX core. The host (e.g., CPU/SoC) can write/read data via AXI, and the UART sends/receives serial data accordingly.
